~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unfortunately, you have to execute the following command by hand:
sudo apt-get install libxslt-dev libxml2-dev

Device tracker platform that supports scanning a FitzBox router for device
presence.

Configuration:

To use the fritz tracker you have to adapt your configuration.yaml by
using the following template:

device_tracker:
  platform: fritz
  host: YOUR_ROUTER_IP
  username: YOUR_ADMIN_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD

host
*Optional
The IP address of your router, e.g. 192.168.0.1.
It is optional since every fritzbox is also reachable by using the 169.254.1.1 IP.

username
*Optional
The username of an user with administrative privileges, usually 'admin'.
However, it seems that it is not necessary to use it in current generation fritzbox routers
because the necessary data can be retrieved anonymously.

password
*Optional
The password for your given admin account.
However, it seems that it is not necessary to use it in current generation fritzbox routers
because the necessary data can be retrieved anonymously.
